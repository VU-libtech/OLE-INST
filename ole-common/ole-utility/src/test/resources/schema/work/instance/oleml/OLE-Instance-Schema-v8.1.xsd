    Changes made for v8
    * Added vendorLineItemIdentifier to itemGroup to captures the vendor ordering identifier to enable easier matching of additional information provided by the vendor after an initial order is placed.</xs:documentation>
    * Removed the document "metadata" (will be stored on Document Store nodes – rather than within the XML documents)

            <xs:documentation>Maps to $6 "Linkage" in multiple MFHD fields.   Data that links fields that are different script representations of each other. Subfield $6 may contain the tag number of an associated field, an occurrence number, a code that identifies the first script encountered in a left-to-right scan of the field, and an indication that the orientation for a display of the field data is right-to-left. A regular (non-880) field may be linked to one or more 880 fields that all contain different script representations of the same data. Subfield $6 is structured as follows: $6 &lt;linking tag&gt;-&lt;occurrence number&gt;/&lt;script identification code&gt;/&lt;field orientation code&gt; Subfield $6 is always the first subfield in the field. Descriptions of multiscript record models, with examples, are in Multiscript Records; specifications for field 880 are under that field; specifications for character sets and repertoires for scripts are found in MARC 21 Specifications for Record Structure, Character Sets, and Exchange Media. Linking tag part contains the tag number of the associated field and is always three characters in length. This part is followed immediately by a hyphen and the two-digit occurrence number part. A different occurrence number is assigned to each set of associated fields within a single record. The function of an occurrence number is to permit the matching of the associated fields (not to sequence the fields within the record). An occurrence number may be assigned at random for each set of associated fields. An occurrence number of less than two digits is right justified and the unused position contains a zero. When there is no associated field to which a field 880 is linked, the occurrence number in subfield $6 is 00. It is used if an agency wants to separate scripts in a record (see Multiscript Records). The linking tag part of subfield $6 will contain the tag that the associated regular field would have had if it had existed in the record. 852&#9;4#$6880-01$a[Location in Latin script] 880&#9;2#$6852-01/(2/r$a[Location in Hebrew script linked to associated field] Occurrence number is followed immediately by a slash (/) and the script identification code. This code identifies the alternate script found in the field. The following codes are used: Code&#9;Script (3&#9;Arabic (B&#9;Latin $1&#9;Chinese, Japanese, Korean (N&#9;Cyrillic (S&#9;Greek (2&#9;Hebrew 880&#9;1#$6852-01/(N$a[Location in Cyrillic script] [The (N identifies the Basic Cyrillic character set.] The entire field need not be in the script identified in subfield $6. If more than one script is present in the field, subfield $6 will contain the identification of the first alternate script encountered in a left-to-right scan of the field. Note also that the script identification code is used in field 880, subfield $6, but this data element is not generally used for subfield $6 of the associated regular field. In the associated field, the data is assumed to be the primary script(s) for the record. In a MARC record, the contents of field 880 are always recorded in their logical order, from the first character to the last, regardless of field orientation. For a display of the field, the default field orientation is left-to-right. When the field contains text that has a right-to-left orientation, the script identification code is followed by a slash (/) and the field orientation code. The MARC field orientation code for right-to-left scripts is the letter r. The orientation code is only included in fields with right-to-left orientation, since left-to-right orientation is the default orientation in 880 fields. (See MARC 21 Specifications for Record Structure, Character Sets, and Exchange Media for a detailed description of field orientation.) 880&#9;1#$6852-01/(2/r$h[Call number in Hebrew script] [The r indicates the right-to-left orientation of the Hebrew script.] Note that the orientation code is used in field 880, subfield $6, but this data element is not generally used for subfield $6 of the associated regular field. In the associated field, the data is assumed to be the usual orientation of the primary script(s) for the record.

This situation may occur when the holdings are extremely complex or the publication pattern varies greatly for only a certain period of time. A unique whole number is used as the linking number in the Textual Holdings field to sequence the field among the linking numbers used in the 853-855/863-865 fields according to the enumeration and chronology recorded in each field.

Subfield $6 may contain the tag number of an associated field, an occurrence number, a code that identifies the first script encountered in a left-to-right scan of the field, and an indication that the orientation for a display of the field data is right-to-left. A regular (non-880) field may be linked to one or more 880 fields that all contain different script representations of the same data. Subfield $6 is structured as follows: $6 &lt;linking tag&gt;-&lt;occurrence number&gt;/&lt;script identification code&gt;/&lt;field orientation code&gt; Subfield $6 is always the first subfield in the field. Descriptions of multiscript record models, with examples, are in Multiscript Records; specifications for field 880 are under that field; specifications for character sets and repertoires for scripts are found in MARC 21 Specifications for Record Structure, Character Sets, and Exchange Media. Linking tag part contains the tag number of the associated field and is always three characters in length. This part is followed immediately by a hyphen and the two-digit occurrence number part. A different occurrence number is assigned to each set of associated fields within a single record. The function of an occurrence number is to permit the matching of the associated fields (not to sequence the fields within the record). An occurrence number may be assigned at random for each set of associated fields. An occurrence number of less than two digits is right justified and the unused position contains a zero. When there is no associated field to which a field 880 is linked, the occurrence number in subfield $6 is 00. It is used if an agency wants to separate scripts in a record (see Multiscript Records). The linking tag part of subfield $6 will contain the tag that the associated regular field would have had if it had existed in the record. 852&#9;4#$6880-01$a[Location in Latin script] 880&#9;2#$6852-01/(2/r$a[Location in Hebrew script linked to associated field] Occurrence number is followed immediately by a slash (/) and the script identification code. This code identifies the alternate script found in the field. The following codes are used: Code&#9;Script (3&#9;Arabic (B&#9;Latin $1&#9;Chinese, Japanese, Korean (N&#9;Cyrillic (S&#9;Greek (2&#9;Hebrew 880&#9;1#$6852-01/(N$a[Location in Cyrillic script] [The (N identifies the Basic Cyrillic character set.] The entire field need not be in the script identified in subfield $6. If more than one script is present in the field, subfield $6 will contain the identification of the first alternate script encountered in a left-to-right scan of the field. Note also that the script identification code is used in field 880, subfield $6, but this data element is not generally used for subfield $6 of the associated regular field. In the associated field, the data is assumed to be the primary script(s) for the record. In a MARC record, the contents of field 880 are always recorded in their logical order, from the first character to the last, regardless of field orientation. For a display of the field, the default field orientation is left-to-right. When the field contains text that has a right-to-left orientation, the script identification code is followed by a slash (/) and the field orientation code. The MARC field orientation code for right-to-left scripts is the letter r. The orientation code is only included in fields with right-to-left orientation, since left-to-right orientation is the default orientation in 880 fields. (See MARC 21 Specifications for Record Structure, Character Sets, and Exchange Media for a detailed description of field orientation.) 880&#9;1#$6852-01/(2/r$h[Call number in Hebrew script] [The r indicates the right-to-left orientation of the Hebrew script.] Note that the orientation code is used in field 880, subfield $6, but this data element is not generally used for subfield $6 of the associated regular field. In the associated field, the data is assumed to be the usual orientation of the primary script(s) for the record.

This situation may occur when the holdings are extremely complex or the publication pattern varies greatly for only a certain period of time. A unique whole number is used as the linking number in the Textual Holdings field to sequence the field among the linking numbers used in the 853-855/863-865 fields according to the enumeration and chronology recorded in each field.

Textual description which may include both the captions and enumeration and chronology for the holdings of a bibliographic item in the collections of the reporting organization. These fields are normally not used in holdings for single-part items. They may be used instead of the coded 853-855 Captions and Pattern and 863-865 Enumeration and Chronology fields for multipart and serial items when those fields cannot be used adequately to describe the holdings. The 866-868 fields may also be used in addition to an Enumeration and Chronology field and any related Captions and Pattern field to record and generate an alternative display for all or part of the enumeration and chronology and captions and pattern fields.  A general description of the four types of holdings data fields, their relationship to each other, and the repeatability of each is given in the Holdings Data--General Information section. Guidelines for recording item information related to holdings data in the 866-868 fields is given in the Item Information--General Information section.

Subfield $6 may contain the tag number of an associated field, an occurrence number, a code that identifies the first script encountered in a left-to-right scan of the field, and an indication that the orientation for a display of the field data is right-to-left. A regular (non-880) field may be linked to one or more 880 fields that all contain different script representations of the same data. Subfield $6 is structured as follows: $6&lt;linking tag&gt;-&lt;occurrence number&gt;/&lt;script identification code&gt;/&lt;field orientation code&gt; Subfield $6 is always the first subfield in the field. Descriptions of multiscript record models, with examples, are in Multiscript Records; specifications for field 880 are under that field; specifications for character sets and repertoires for scripts are found in MARC 21 Specifications for Record Structure, Character Sets, and Exchange Media. Linking tag part contains the tag number of the associated field and is always three characters in length. This part is followed immediately by a hyphen and the two-digit occurrence number part. A different occurrence number is assigned to each set of associated fields within a single record. The function of an occurrence number is to permit the matching of the associated fields (not to sequence the fields within the record). An occurrence number may be assigned at random for each set of associated fields. An occurrence number of less than two digits is right justified and the unused position contains a zero. When there is no associated field to which a field 880 is linked, the occurrence number in subfield $6 is 00. It is used if an agency wants to separate scripts in a record (see Multiscript Records). The linking tag part of subfield $6 will contain the tag that the associated regular field would have had if it had existed in the record. 852&#9;4#$6880-01$a[Location in Latin script] 880&#9;2#$6852-01/(2/r$a[Location in Hebrew script linked to associated field] Occurrence number is followed immediately by a slash (/) and the script identification code. This code identifies the alternate script found in the field. The following codes are used: Code&#9;Script (3&#9;Arabic (B&#9;Latin $1&#9;Chinese, Japanese, Korean (N&#9;Cyrillic (S&#9;Greek (2&#9;Hebrew 880&#9;1#$6852-01/(N$a[Location in Cyrillic script] [The (N identifies the Basic Cyrillic character set.] The entire field need not be in the script identified in subfield $6. If more than one script is present in the field, subfield $6 will contain the identification of the first alternate script encountered in a left-to-right scan of the field. Note also that the script identification code is used in field 880, subfield $6, but this data element is not generally used for subfield $6 of the associated regular field. In the associated field, the data is assumed to be the primary script(s) for the record. In a MARC record, the contents of field 880 are always recorded in their logical order, from the first character to the last, regardless of field orientation. For a display of the field, the default field orientation is left-to-right. When the field contains text that has a right-to-left orientation, the script identification code is followed by a slash (/) and the field orientation code. The MARC field orientation code for right-to-left scripts is the letter r. The orientation code is only included in fields with right-to-left orientation, since left-to-right orientation is the default orientation in 880 fields. (See MARC 21 Specifications for Record Structure, Character Sets, and Exchange Media for a detailed description of field orientation.) 880&#9;1#$6852-01/(2/r$h[Call number in Hebrew script] [The r indicates the right-to-left orientation of the Hebrew script.] Note that the orientation code is used in field 880, subfield $6, but this data element is not generally used for subfield $6 of the associated regular field. In the associated field, the data is assumed to be the usual orientation of the primary script(s) for the record.

A-B Holdings data are recorded in the linked 853-855 Captions and Pattern/863-865 Enumeration and Chronology fields but the display form of the holdings is recorded in a Textual Holdings field.   Linking number is unique and sequences the holdings data with the enumeration and chronology of the 863-865 fields When part of the holdings data is recorded in the 853-855 Captions and Pattern/863-865 Enumeration and Chronology fields and part is recorded in the Textual Holdings fields, displays may be generated from both types of fields. This situation may occur when the holdings are extremely complex or the publication pattern varies greatly for only a certain period of time. A unique whole number is used as the linking number in the Textual Holdings field to sequence the field among the linking numbers used in the 853-855/863-865 fields according to the enumeration and chronology recorded in each field.

Subfield $6 may contain the tag number of an associated field, an occurrence number, a code that identifies the first script encountered in a left-to-right scan of the field, and an indication that the orientation for a display of the field data is right-to-left. A regular (non-880) field may be linked to one or more 880 fields that all contain different script representations of the same data. Subfield $6 is structured as follows: $6 &lt;linking tag&gt;-&lt;occurrence number&gt;/&lt;script identification code&gt;/&lt;field orientation code&gt; Subfield $6 is always the first subfield in the field. Descriptions of multiscript record models, with examples, are in Multiscript Records; specifications for field 880 are under that field; specifications for character sets and repertoires for scripts are found in MARC 21 Specifications for Record Structure, Character Sets, and Exchange Media. Linking tag part contains the tag number of the associated field and is always three characters in length. This part is followed immediately by a hyphen and the two-digit occurrence number part. A different occurrence number is assigned to each set of associated fields within a single record. The function of an occurrence number is to permit the matching of the associated fields (not to sequence the fields within the record). An occurrence number may be assigned at random for each set of associated fields. An occurrence number of less than two digits is right justified and the unused position contains a zero. When there is no associated field to which a field 880 is linked, the occurrence number in subfield $6 is 00. It is used if an agency wants to separate scripts in a record (see Multiscript Records). The linking tag part of subfield $6 will contain the tag that the associated regular field would have had if it had existed in the record. 852&#9;4#$6880-01$a[Location in Latin script] 880&#9;2#$6852-01/(2/r$a[Location in Hebrew script linked to associated field] Occurrence number is followed immediately by a slash (/) and the script identification code.

If more than one script is present in the field, subfield $6 will contain the identification of the first alternate script encountered in a left-to-right scan of the field. Note also that the script identification code is used in field 880, subfield $6, but this data element is not generally used for subfield $6 of the associated regular field. In the associated field, the data is assumed to be the primary script(s) for the record. In a MARC record, the contents of field 880 are always recorded in their logical order, from the first character to the last, regardless of field orientation. For a display of the field, the default field orientation is left-to-right. When the field contains text that has a right-to-left orientation, the script identification code is followed by a slash (/) and the field orientation code. The MARC field orientation code for right-to-left scripts is the letter r. The orientation code is only included in fields with right-to-left orientation, since left-to-right orientation is the default orientation in 880 fields. (See MARC 21 Specifications for Record Structure, Character Sets, and Exchange Media for a detailed description of field orientation.) 880&#9;1#$6852-01/(2/r$h[Call number in Hebrew script] [The r indicates the right-to-left orientation of the Hebrew script.] Note that the orientation code is used in field 880, subfield $6, but this data element is not generally used for subfield $6 of the associated regular field.

This situation may occur when the holdings are extremely complex or the publication pattern varies greatly for only a certain period of time.

                        <xs:documentation>Maps to MFHD 856 Electronic Location and Access.  Unlike MFHD, the OLE Instance document captures this information with Item data, not Holdings data and it is not repeatable.  When extracted to the MFHD format, this data will need to be mapped to the 856 field (and subfields) for the Holdings level.  Information required to locate an electronic resource. The information identifies the electronic location containing the resource or from which it is available. It also contains information needed to retrieve the resource by the access method identified in the first indicator position. The relationship of the electronic location and access information in field 856 to the resource identified by the record as a whole is identified by the second indicator. The information contained in this field is sufficient to allow for the electronic transfer of a file, subscription to an electronic journal, or logon to an electronic resource. In some cases, only unique data elements are recorded which allow the user to access a locator table on a remote host containing the remaining information needed to access the resource.  Field 856 is repeated when the location data elements vary (the URL in subfield $u or subfields $a, $b, $d, when used). It is also repeated when more than one access method is used, different portions of the item are available electronically, mirror sites are recorded, different formats/resolutions with different URLs are indicated, and related items are recorded.  See the Guidelines for the Use of Field 856 for a more thorough discussion on the use of field 856.  This field is identical to field 856 (Electronic Location and Access) defined in the MARC 21 Format for Bibliographic Data.

Electronic format type may be taken from enumerated lists such as registered Internet Media Types (MIME types).  The intent of specifying this element is to provide information necessary to allow people or machines to make decisions about the usability of the encoded data (what hardware and software might be required to display or execute it, for example). The electronic format type also determines the file transfer mode, or how data are transferred through a network. (Usually, a text file can be transferred as character data which generally restricts the text to characters in the ASCII (American National Standard Code for Information Interchange (ANSI X3.4)) character set (i.e., the basic Latin alphabet, digits 0-9, a few special characters, and most punctuation marks) and text files with characters outside of the ASCII set, or non-textual data (e.g., computer programs, image data) must be transferred using another binary mode.)

The syntax of these elements is: &lt;Parity&gt;-&lt;Number Data Bits&gt;-&lt;Number Stop Bits&gt; If only the parity is given, the other elements of settings and their related hyphens are omitted (i.e., &lt;Parity&gt;). If one of the other two elements is given, the hyphen for the missing element is recorded in its proper position (i.e., &lt;Parity&gt;--&lt;Number Stop Bits&gt; or &lt;Parity&gt;-&lt;Number Data Bits&gt;- ). The values for parity are: O (Odd), E (Even), N (None), S (Space), and M (Mark).

                                <xs:documentation>Maps to MFHD  856 $6 Linkage  Data that links fields that are different script representations of each other. Subfield $6 may contain the tag number of an associated field, an occurrence number, a code that identifies the first script encountered in a left-to-right scan of the field, and an indication that the orientation for a display of the field data is right-to-left. A regular (non-880) field may be linked to one or more 880 fields that all contain different script representations of the same data. Subfield $6 is structured as follows: $6&lt;linking tag&gt;-&lt;occurrence number&gt;/&lt;script identification code&gt;/&lt;field orientation code&gt; Subfield $6 is always the first subfield in the field. Descriptions of multiscript record models, with examples, are in Multiscript Records; specifications for field 880 are under that field; specifications for character sets and repertoires for scripts are found in MARC 21 Specifications for Record Structure, Character Sets, and Exchange Media. Linking tag part contains the tag number of the associated field and is always three characters in length. This part is followed immediately by a hyphen and the two-digit occurrence number part. A different occurrence number is assigned to each set of associated fields within a single record. The function of an occurrence number is to permit the matching of the associated fields (not to sequence the fields within the record). An occurrence number may be assigned at random for each set of associated fields. An occurrence number of less than two digits is right justified and the unused position contains a zero. When there is no associated field to which a field 880 is linked, the occurrence number in subfield $6 is 00. It is used if an agency wants to separate scripts in a record (see Multiscript Records). The linking tag part of subfield $6 will contain the tag that the associated regular field would have had if it had existed in the record. 852&#9;4#$6880-01$a[Location in Latin script] 880&#9;2#$6852-01/(2/r$a[Location in Hebrew script linked to associated field] Occurrence number is followed immediately by a slash (/) and the script identification code. This code identifies the alternate script found in the field. The following codes are used: Code&#9;Script (3&#9;Arabic (B&#9;Latin $1&#9;Chinese, Japanese, Korean (N&#9;Cyrillic (S&#9;Greek (2&#9;Hebrew 880&#9;1#$6852-01/(N$a[Location in Cyrillic script] [The (N identifies the Basic Cyrillic character set.] The entire field need not be in the script identified in subfield $6. If more than one script is present in the field, subfield $6 will contain the identification of the first alternate script encountered in a left-to-right scan of the field. Note also that the script identification code is used in field 880, subfield $6, but this data element is not generally used for subfield $6 of the associated regular field. In the associated field, the data is assumed to be the primary script(s) for the record. In a MARC record, the contents of field 880 are always recorded in their logical order, from the first character to the last, regardless of field orientation. For a display of the field, the default field orientation is left-to-right. When the field contains text that has a right-to-left orientation, the script identification code is followed by a slash (/) and the field orientation code. The MARC field orientation code for right-to-left scripts is the letter r. The orientation code is only included in fields with right-to-left orientation, since left-to-right orientation is the default orientation in 880 fields. (See MARC 21 Specifications for Record Structure, Character Sets, and Exchange Media for a detailed description of field orientation.) 880&#9;1#$6852-01/(2/r$h[Call number in Hebrew script] [The r indicates the right-to-left orientation of the Hebrew script.] Note that the orientation code is used in field 880, subfield $6, but this data element is not generally used for subfield $6 of the associated regular field. In the associated field, the data is assumed to be the usual orientation of the primary script(s) for the record.

This situation may occur when the holdings are extremely complex or the publication pattern varies greatly for only a certain period of time. A unique whole number is used as the linking number in the Textual Holdings field to sequence the field among the linking numbers used in the 853-855/863-865 fields according to the enumeration and chronology recorded in each field.</xs:documentation>
