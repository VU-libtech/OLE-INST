    <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract">Beginning in the summer of 1998, Archaeology In Annapolis
        performed a multi-phased archaeological investigation in and around
        the James Brice House, a National Historic Landmark with associated
        archaeological deposits (18AP38), located at 42 East Street in the
        historic District of the city of Annapolis, Maryland. The work was
        done under a series of contracts to the International Masonry
        Institute, owners of the structure. Funding for the project was
        provided by the IMI and the Maryland Historical Trust.
        A total of twenty-eight units were excavated during the initial
        portion of the project, and another four were excavated in support of
        a secondary project designed to rehabilitate the retaining wall
        located at the southern edge of the South Yard. In addition, several
        trenches excavated during construction at the site were profiled, and
        the lowering of the grade in the South Yard was monitored by
        Archaeology in Annapolis staff.
        Testing in the South Yard revealed evidence of a number of
        filling and landform modification episodes dating from the periods
        following construction of the Brice House up to the beginning of the
        twentieth century. Further evidence of twentieth century modification
        to the yard space was revealed in the form of a number of utility
        trenches and related features. Features related to no-longer extant
        stairs including brick piers and postholes were discovered in a number
        of areas. Finally, an oyster shell drainage feature and associated
        evidence of African-American religious practices were recovered from a
        trench and excavation unit at the western edge of the yard space.
        Excavation in the interior of the West Wing revealed the presence
        of three major stratigraphic units with a large number of associated
        structural and depositional features. The first of these depositional
        units consisted of twentieth century deposits associated with
        modification of the interior of the Wing, and the majority of this
        material had been recently disturbed. The second stratigraphic unit
        consisted of material associated with the construction of the Brice
        House between 1767 and 1773. The final stratigraphic unit in the West
        Wing consisted of structural features and a floor deposit dating to
        the early 18th century. This material is potentially related to a
        store owned by Captain John Brice and his son John Brice II.
        Excavations in the East Wing and Hyphen also revealed a number of
        stratigraphic units related to the initial construction and subsequent
        modification of the Brice House structure. In addition, a large
        deposit of late nineteenth and early twentieth century material
        associated with the religious practices of African-American occupants
        of the house was discovered beneath remnants of a brick floor in the
        interior of the East Wing.
