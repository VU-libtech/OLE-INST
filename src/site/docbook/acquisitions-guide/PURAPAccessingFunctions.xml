    <title>Accessing Purchasing and Accounts Payable Functions</title>
    <para role="Body Text">The Kuali OLE Purchasing and Accounts Payable module includes several e-docs
        to help your institution manage its procurement processes. Kuali OLE users may initiate Requisition
        e-docs to request that orders be placed for goods or services. Fully approved Requisition e-docs are
        then processed by departmental staff and then become purchase orders (POs). Under certain conditions
        (specified by your institution's business rules in Kuali OLE), fully approved requisitions may
        become POs automatically without any additional processing.</para>
    <para role="Body Text">Each PO is an official request for goods or services to a specified vendor
        for an agreed-upon cost. After goods are delivered or services rendered, Kuali OLE allows for the
        processing of vendor invoices through the Payment Request e-doc, which applies full or partial
        payment against a PO. Credits received from vendors may also be processed on a Credit Memo e-doc.
        Both payments and credit memos may then be applied to outstanding invoices when payment is
        due.</para>
    <para role="Body Text">Purchasing and Accounts Payable e-docs are accessible from the Select/Acquire
        tab. </para>
