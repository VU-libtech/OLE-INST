    <para role="Body Text">Users do not interact directly with OLE batch processes, but some users
        want to understand how these processes keep the data base up to date. For users who are
        interested, the following table summarizes the functions of the systemâ€™s Purchasing/Accounts
        Payable batch processes. These processes, which are run according to a predetermined
        schedule, not only keep your database up to date but, in some cases, generate new e-docs as
        needed to make certain types of adjustments. </para>
