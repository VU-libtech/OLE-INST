            resources. The module manages pre-order and selection of all types of order requests for
            library materials, and upholds the complete purchasing, receiving and payment operations
            of ordered library materials. Select &amp; Acquire components also provide workflow

            interval check-in, and productivity reports. </para><para role="Normal"/><para role="Normal">Financial and budgeting structures within the system allow flexibility for
            library materials to be purchased outright, leased, or licensed. OLE offers fully

            ERM component will support the lifecycle of electronic resources and packages including
            licensing, purchasing, and daily administration. The Global Open Knowledgebase (GOKb), a
            community-managed knowledge base of subscribed resources, will be tightly integrated

            <para role="Normal">Acquisitions transactional documents within OLE require a fund to
                pay for items in the order process. OLE relies on a variety of Chart of Accounts
                (COA) tables to function. These tables define attributes and values used by the
                system to validate transactions. They also control the often complex relationships
                between elements in the Chart of Accounts that must be leveraged for internal and
                external reporting. For example, tables store basic information such as the sub-fund
                groups to which new accounts may be assigned and the calendar month that correlates
                to the first month of your institution's fiscal year. This type of flexibility is
                one of the features that make OLE a highly configurable application to support
                Acquisitions.</para>

                generation of offsets and the posting of transactions to the balance tables, from
                various acquisitions transactions. The GL is the official repository for all of OLE
                financial and budget information. It stores account balance and budget information
                for multiple fiscal years and stores a detailed record of all financial
                transactions. Users interact with the GL by creating electronic documents that, when
                fully approved, are posted to the GL. The OLE General Ledger is a batch processing
                application that expects all GL pending transactions to be collected in batch form
                from the GL entry files. The daily batch contains transactions generated in OLE as
                well as transactions created in external applications and converted to the GL entry

            Invoice document was created to accommodate many-to-one purchase orders to payment

            negative amounts or credits as separate credit memos. Payments (âpaidâ) display on
            purchase order line items. Prorating on Invoices and Payment Requests allows users to
            take a $500 Shipping &amp; Handling charge (or other types) Â and optionally assign
            accounting lines to it (KFS behavior), or prorate it across line items: manually, by
            quantity, or by dollar amounts. OLE accommodates advance payments to vendors (deposit

        </note></section><section><title>Electronic Resource Management (ERM)</title><para role="Normal">Electronic Resource Management covers all aspects of managing titles that are
            delivered or provided in electronic form. These materials might consist of e-books,
            e-journals, images, music, video, etc. Many of these resources are continuing serials
            while others, such as e-books, are one-time purchases. Managing electronic resources is
            highly complex because they are purchased and billed in many different ways â an
            institution may be purchasing a single journal title, an aggregated database with 5,000
            titles that change throughout the year, or a journal package that contains 500
            individual titles as well as several bundles with several titles each. In addition to
            purchasing workflows comparable to print counterparts, acquiring electronic resources
            may involve one (or more) trial periods for evaluation and generally requires complex
            negotiation of license and business terms. The workflow for making electronic resources
            accessible to patrons is difficult to manage because there is no physical item being
            tracked through a cataloging process. Electronic resources also require ongoing
            monitoring and management over their lifecycle to ensure continuous access in addition
            to workflows for disabling access to a resource no longer being licensed. While much
            work will still need to occur in future releases, OLE has taken some initial steps with
            an E-Resource Record in the 1.0 release, much more development will occur in the 2.0
            release. </para>

                about an electronic resource acquisition, including the title(s) involved and the
                content provider. Within the OLE user interface, the E-Resource Record presents a
                single, unified view of all information related to acquisition of an individual
                electronic resource or group of electronic resources, including titles, payment,
                licensing, administrative, and contact information. There are several general
                workflows that make up the electronic acquisitions process after a selector or
                patron requests the purchase of an electronic resource, these will be managed with
                the E-Resource Record. </para>

            <para role="Normal">OLE created extensive specifications for the licensing process.
                Licensing is a variable step in the electronic acquisitions process. Some resources
                do not require a license at all and can be used within the guidelines of copyright
                law, while others require extensive negotiation of business and licensing terms. In
                lieu of a negotiated license, some vendors use standard Shared Electronic Resource
                Understanding (SERU) agreements to bypass complicated licensing processes. The goal
                of the licensing specifications is for a license editor that is flexible enough to
                encode the rights for a variety of scenarios making them easy to query, rather than
                recording the terms only for fully negotiated licenses. License Request e-documents,
                used to manage negotiations, are available in OLE.</para>
