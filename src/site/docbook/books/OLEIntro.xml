        the associated maintenance documents (located on the <emphasis role="bold"
            >Maintenance</emphasis> tab). Section titles within the chapters correspond with a
        heading on the associated tab. These sections are divided into subsections covering
        individual functions. For each function, the applicable subsection presents a breadcrumb
        trail showing how to access the function and information on the layout and fields on the
        related screen(s). As appropriate, some subsections include business rules and routing
        information for e-docs and/or special instructions for performing activities.</para>

            <para role="Normal">This section is intended to provide a basic overview of OLE’s
                circulation features and functions of interest to the circulation librarian. It
                therefore assumes familiarity with commonly used terms or phrases (e.g., “patron”,
                “borrower”, “shelving location”, “recall”, “checkin”, “checkout”, etc.). More
                detailed descriptions of functionality and instructions on using the circulation
                staff interface are provided in the <link linkend="DeliverModule"><emphasis>Deliver

                <title>Introduction</title>
                <para role="Normal">OLE circulation is based on the ability to link patron data to
                    item data in various combinations under various circumstances and conditions.
                    While the combinations are often common to all libraries, circumstances and
                    conditions vary considerably. Therefore, OLE allows each library to select a
                    wide range of options to meet local circulation policy requirements, e.g.,
                    patron-related blocks, item-related blocks, loan periods, notice types and
                    notice frequency, etc. </para>

                    patron types, all item types, and all shelving locations, or they could set up a
                    policy for each unique combination of the three elements. Each institution could
                    also set up a limited number of policies for various groupings of the three

                    demand-driven acquisitions of library resources. The module manages pre-order

                    the complete purchasing, receiving and payment operations of ordered library

                    OLE offers fully automated EDI features for direct data exchange with vendors.
                    With the 2.0 release, the ERM component will support the lifecycle of electronic
                    resources and packages including licensing, purchasing, and daily
                    administration. The Global Open Knowledgebase (GOKb), a community-managed
                    knowledge base of subscribed resources, will be tightly integrated with OLE for
                    ingesting and maintaining acquired electronic books and serials. </para>

                        fund to pay for items in the order process. OLE relies on a variety of Chart
                        of Accounts (COA) tables to function. These tables define attributes and
                        values used by the system to validate transactions. They also control the
                        often complex relationships between elements in the Chart of Accounts that
                        must be leveraged for internal and external reporting. For example, tables
                        store basic information such as the sub-fund groups to which new accounts
                        may be assigned and the calendar month that correlates to the first month of
                        your institution's fiscal year. This type of flexibility is one of the
                        features that make OLE a highly configurable application to support

                            overages to a $/%.  Sufficient fund checks can occur on Requisitions

                <para role="Normal">Electronic Resource Management covers all aspects of managing
                    titles that are delivered or provided in electronic form. These materials might
                    consist of e-books, e-journals, images, music, video, etc. Many of these
                    resources are continuing serials while others, such as e-books, are one-time
                    purchases. Managing electronic resources is highly complex because they are
                    purchased and billed in many different ways – an institution may be purchasing a
                    single journal title, an aggregated database with 5,000 titles that change
                    throughout the year, or a journal package that contains 500 individual titles as
                    well as several bundles with several titles each. In addition to purchasing
                    workflows comparable to print counterparts, acquiring electronic resources may
                    involve one (or more) trial periods for evaluation and generally requires
                    complex negotiation of license and business terms. The workflow for making
                    electronic resources accessible to patrons is difficult to manage because there
                    is no physical item being tracked through a cataloging process. Electronic
                    resources also require ongoing monitoring and management over their lifecycle to
                    ensure continuous access in addition to workflows for disabling access to a
                    resource no longer being licensed. While much work will still need to occur in
                    future releases, OLE has taken some initial steps with an E-Resource Record in
                    the 1.0 release, much more development will occur in the 2.0 release. </para>

                        E-Resource Record presents a single, unified view of all information related
                        to acquisition of an individual electronic resource or group of electronic
                        resources, including titles, payment, licensing, administrative, and contact
                        information. There are several general workflows that make up the electronic
                        acquisitions process after a selector or patron requests the purchase of an
                        electronic resource, these will be managed with the E-Resource Record. </para>

                    <para role="Normal">OLE created extensive specifications for the licensing
                        process. Licensing is a variable step in the electronic acquisitions
                        process. Some resources do not require a license at all and can be used
                        within the guidelines of copyright law, while others require extensive
                        negotiation of business and licensing terms. In lieu of a negotiated
                        license, some vendors use standard Shared Electronic Resource Understanding
                        (SERU) agreements to bypass complicated licensing processes. The goal of the
                        licensing specifications is for a license editor that is flexible enough to
                        encode the rights for a variety of scenarios making them easy to query,
                        rather than recording the terms only for fully negotiated licenses. License

                        OLE.</para>
