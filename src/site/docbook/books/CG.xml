            showing how to access the function and information on the layout and fields on the
            related screen(s). As appropriate, some subsections include business rules and routing
            information for e-docs and/or special instructions for performing activities.</para>

            <para>In order to work efficiently in the system’s Deliver screens, you need to
                understand the basics of the user interface. For information and instructions on
                logging on and off, navigating, understanding the components of screens, and
                performing basic operations in the screens, see <link
