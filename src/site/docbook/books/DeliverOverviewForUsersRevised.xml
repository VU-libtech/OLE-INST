        features and functions of interest to the circulation librarian. It therefore assumes
        familiarity with commonly used terms or phrases (e.g., “patron”, “borrower”, “shelving
        location”, “recall”, “checkin”, “checkout”, etc.). More detailed descriptions of
        functionality and instructions on using the circulation staff interface are provided in the

            various combinations under various circumstances and conditions. While the combinations
            are often common to all libraries, circumstances and conditions vary considerably.
            Therefore, OLE allows each library to select a wide range of options to meet local
            circulation policy requirements, e.g., patron-related blocks, item-related blocks, loan
            periods, notice types and notice frequency, etc. </para><para role="Normal"/><para role="Normal">Like many other library systems, OLE circulation rules are based on the combination of:</para><para role="Normal"/><orderedlist numeration="arabic" spacing="normal"><listitem><para role="List Paragraph">Patron type (e.g., “undergraduate”, “graduate”, “faculty”, “staff”, etc.)</para></listitem><listitem><para role="List Paragraph">An item’s shelving location (e.g., “Main Library”, “Bookstacks”, etc.)</para></listitem><listitem><para role="List Paragraph">An item’s item type (e.g., “Book”, “DVD”, “Map”, etc.)</para></listitem></orderedlist><para role="Normal"/><para role="Normal">OLE allows as many patron types, locations, and item types as your institution
            may need, as well as the creation of infinite circulation rules. Each institution or
            library could set up ONE policy that applies to all patron types, all item types, and
            all shelving locations, or they could set up a policy for each unique combination of the
            three elements. Each institution could also set up a limited number of policies for
            various groupings of the three elements—this being the option that most libraries will
            probably follow. </para><para role="Normal"/><para role="Normal">Libraries apply circulation policies by using the Loan, Return, and Request functions.</para><section><title>Basic Functions</title><para role="Normal">OLE provides the features/functions that most circulation librarians would consider essential for any modern, up-to-date system.

An option exists to include or exclude patron-specific data from the history record. Another option is to create a temporary circulation history record for the purpose of allowing patrons to view their previous loans. This record, if it exists, does include patron-specific data; these can be purged by a batch process run on a locally-determined schedule limited to records of a specified age. </para><para role="Normal"/><para role="Normal">Returning an item also updates the item status in the item record. If the Circulation Desk has defined an interval between return and reshelving, the item status becomes “Recently Returned” (or whatever literal is wanted). After the interval, a batch process changes the item status to “Available” (or whatever literal is wanted). </para><para role="Normal"/><para role="Normal">During Return, the system also applies any overdue policies that may be in effect, e.g., if fines are charged per day/hour, the Return transaction calculates the amount and creates an overdue fine bill; this is then sent to the patron after running a batch process See <link linkend="_Notices_and_Other">Notices and Other Batch Processes</link> for more information.</para><para role="Normal"/><para role="Normal">Return also captures any pending request(s) for a returned item and prompts the operator to act accordingly.
