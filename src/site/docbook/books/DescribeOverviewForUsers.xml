            <para role="Normal">Cataloging is the term most commonly used in libraries for what OLE
                defines as Describe and Manage activities. Cataloging involves the creation and
                maintenance of various kinds of core metadata that are used to support the business
                activities of the library as well as the library’s OPAC.</para>
            <para role="Normal"/>
            <para role="Normal">The OLE Describe-Manage module incorporates the creation and
                management of bibliographic, OLE Instance (holdings and item) records as well as
                electronic Instances. Support is confined to MARC 21 but will extend to Dublin Core
                in a later release. Ultimately OLE will be flexible to support multiple formats of
                bibliographic and holdings records along with licenses and authority records.
                Reporting functionality will also be included within OLE but methodology and details
                are yet to be determined.</para>

                        holdings are maintained in a format specific to OLE called “OLE holdings”
                        which also provides the ability to record summary holdings information. In
                        the future, other types of holdings formats (collectively referred to as
                        “source holdings”) will be supported. “OLE holdings” records have a field
                        for summary holdings statements. Thus, some sites may find that they can use
                        “OLE holdings” exclusively without the need to create MARC holdings records.
                        At the present time, it is anticipated that a cataloger would be able to
                        convert an “OLE holdings” record to a MARC holdings record by clicking on a
                        button, but not vice-versa.</para>

                <para role="Normal">OLE offers flexibility to cater to each library’s needs. With
                    that flexibility includes “bound-withs”, a physical object that contains two or
                    more titles. The requirement of “bound withs” can be satisfied by having one
                    item record linked to a holdings record which is in turn linked to two or more
                    bibliographic records. When a library wishes to have a bibliographic record for
                    a series as well as separate bibliographic records (“analytics”) for the
                    individual titles in the series, this requirement can be met by having one item
                    record linked to two or more holdings records, with each holdings record linked
                    to a different bibliographic record. </para>

            <para role="Normal">An OLE site may rename these levels and need not use all of them.
                All locations must be unique. Thus, if an OLE site has two libraries, and each
                library has a “stacks” location, two different stacks locations would have to be
                defined in OLE, one for each library.</para>

            <para role="Normal">Locations are ordinarily recorded in holdings records, and only one
                location may be used per record. Typically it would be the lowest level in the
                location hierarchy that is known. Higher levels of location may be inferred from the
                level specified in the record because of the hierarchy that has been defined in the
                OLE maintenance documents. The location recorded in a holdings record is the place
                where something is ordinarily shelved or housed. Shelving locations are sometimes
                also recorded in item records; the “item” location is a temporary location for the
                item, such as “Reserve.” </para>
