/**
 * This class represents a CashDetailTypeCode, which is used to differentiate records of the same general data structure from one
 * another. For example, a CashReceiptDocument has checks and so does a BursarDepositDocument. To be able to re-use the same table
 * and data structure, we need a field that can act as a flag. Another example involves the fact that a CashReceipt contains a coin
 * record, a currency record, and a change out record (aggregated coin and currency together). Since we use the same tables to
 * represent this, we need an attribute to help differentiate between the bunch especially when they all three must co-exist within
 * the same parent CashReceiptDocument instance.
