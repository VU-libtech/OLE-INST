 * 2. Using the document number, look for the document in KREW_DOC_HDR_T and update
 * APP_DOC_STAT and APP_DOC_STAT_MDFN_DT columns if data does not exist in these columns.
 * 3. STAT_CD columns in purap documents will be set to null.
 * 4. The documents in KREW_DOC_HDR_EXT_T table will be reindexed.
